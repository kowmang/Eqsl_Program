    1. Introduction <br>
    <br>
    <u>Database and Administration Program for EQSL Cards</u><br>
    <br>
    The program is designed to import QSL cards downloaded from the eqsl.cc website using the "AC9HP Downloader program",<br>
    based on the fixed folder structure and file name structure of the image files,<br>
    and write them to an SQLite3 database, which holds your log in .adif format to crosscheck the incoming cards.<br> 
    Individual cards you may receive per mail, can also be entered and added per hand.<br>
    A search function makes it easy to find individual or multiple cards (for awards, diplomas, etc.),<br> 
    which can then be viewed or converted back to .png format via a export function in a specific folder.<br>
    <br>
    The program is written in Python, and the GUI is created with QT Designer.<br>
    </p>
