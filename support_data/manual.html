    <p>
    1. Introduction <br>
    <br>
    <u>Database and Administration Program for EQSL Cards</u><br>
    <br>
    The program is designed to import QSL cards downloaded from the eqsl.cc website using the "AC9HP Downloader program",<br>
    based on the fixed folder structure and file name structure of the image files,<br>
    and write them to an SQLite3 database, which holds your log in .adif format to crosscheck the incoming cards.<br> 
    Individual cards you may receive per mail, can also be entered and added per hand.<br>
    A search function makes it easy to find individual or multiple cards (for awards, diplomas, etc.),<br> 
    which can then be viewed or converted back to .png format via a export function in a specific folder.<br>
    <br>
    The program is written in Python, and the GUI is created with QT Designer.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    2. Installation <br> //FIXME: Has to be redone after finishing the program<br>

    3.5 Help Menu <br>

    In the Help Menu you can open this User Manual or view info about the Eqsl Program.<br>



    4. Start with the work <br>

    4.1 Settings <br>

    To start working with the program, first ensure that you have set up your database and imported your ADIF log file
    via the Settings window. There for you can have more SQLite3 databases in this program (only to not forget to change
    to the correct one, where you want to store the images) so you can do for different callsigns or sota or pota and so on.
    
    When you decide to have more then one database, you can import different adif files in those databases or when you have 
    only one for all logfile you can also use this on different databases, because the data thats in the main window is shown
    will be automaticly filtered to only show entries which has a image stored. The rest is in the database but will not
    be shown.<br>
    
    So let´s start from top to bottom main window click on File then on Settings. The Settings Window will open.<br>

     Go to the Database section and click on Select Database Button to choose the database you want to work with.
     If this is the first time you fired up this program click on "New DB" to create a new SQLite3 database, it opens a
     browser so you can choose the destination of your database and also its name. Hit Save and the path and name of the 
     new database is shown in the database selection.<br>

     Then go to the ADIF Log File section and click on Select Button to choose your ADIF log file you wish to import into 
     the new database. If you do this in a month again only the new ones will be written into database (duplicate check).<br>

    Finally go to the Export Folder section and click on Select Button to choose the folder where you want to export your
    QSL card images later if necessary.<br>
    After setting all paths, click on "Cancel Button" to leave the window, changes will be automaticly saved.<br>

    Now you are back in the main window and ready to start importing QSL cards.<br>
    You can choose between Single Card Import or Bulk Card Import.<br>
    

    4.2 Bulk Card Import <br>

    Lets start with Bulk Card Import first, click on Import, then Bulk Card Import and the Bulk Card Import window opens.<br>

    Here there are some things to consider:<br>
    The program expects the file names of the QSL card images to follow a specific format,<br>
    which is defined by the "AC9HP Downloader program" when downloading cards from eqsl.cc.<br>

    The expected file name format is:<br> 

    Callsign=EA2BHE_VisitorCallsign=OE4VMB_QSODate=20231015_Band=20M_Mode=FT8.png<br>  
    or
    Callsign=EA2BHE_VisitorCallsign=OE4VMB_QSODate=20231015_Band=20M_Mode=FT8.jpg

    The program uses this information to crosscheck with the database and import the cards correctly.<br>
    So make sure that the images you want to import follow this naming convention.<br>

    In the future versions there will be also support for other file name conventions.

    When you have the images stored in a folder with the correct file names,<br>
    click on the "Select Button" to browse to the folder, where the card images are stored.<br>

    Then click on the "Import Button" to import all images from the folder into the database.<br>
    Once completed, a message will confirm the successful import, numbers of imports and rejected.<br>

    But what happens now in the background? The program will read each image file in the selected folder,<br>
    extract the relevant information from the file name, and crosscheck it with the entries in your database.<br>
    If a matching entry is found, the program will convert the image into a SQLite3 image format named .blob (yes,
    really it is named so) and store it in the database associated with that entry.<br>
    If no matching entry is found, the program will skip that image and move on to the next one.<br>
    This process continues until all images in the folder have been processed.<br>  

    After the import is complete, you can view the imported cards in the main window of the program.<br>
    The database view will show the entries that have associated images, allowing you to easily manage and
    organize your QSL cards.<br>



    4.3 Single Card Import <br>

    Now let´s try the Single Card Import, click on Import, then Single Card Import and the Single Card Import window opens.<br>

    Here you can import individual QSL cards, which you may have received per mail.<br>
    You have to fill in the asked fields for the crosscheck with the database:<br>
    
    - Call Sign: Call sign as used in the QSO.<br>
    - QSO Date: Enter the date of the QSO in YYYYMMDD format.<br> //FIXME: Date Conventions!!!
    - Band: Enter the band on which the QSO took place (e.g., 20M, 40M).<br>
    - Mode: Enter the mode of communication used (e.g., FT8, SSB).<br>

    Click on the "Select Button" to browse to the image file of the card.<br>

    Then click on the "Import Button" to import the image into the database.<br>  
    Once completed, a message will confirm the successful import or if the card could not be matched.<br>

    In the background, the program will read the selected image file, and procced like in the bulk import.

    After the import is complete, you can view the imported cards in the main window of the program.<br>
    The database view will show the entries that have associated images, allowing you to easily manage and
    organize your QSL cards.<br>

    4.4 Search and showing QSL Card Images <br>

    In the main window, you can use the search function to find specific QSL cards based on various criteria.<br>
    You can enter search terms in the search field and click on the "Search Button" to filter the database view.<br>
    The results will be displayed in the database view, showing only the entries that match your search criteria.<br>
    You can click on any entry in the database view to see a preview of the associated QSL card image in the Image
    Preview section (if no image is selected there is a default image shown).<br> 

    If you want to clear the search and view all entries again, simply click on the "Reset Button".<br>

    When you searched for a specific entry and want to see the image larger or have more than one entry, just mark them all with the 
    "Mark all Button" or click on them in the database view, to select some specific. Then hit the "Show Button" and a larger
    image viewer will open up and you can click through the images.<br>

    4.5 Export QSL Card Images <br>

    If you wish to export QSL card images from the database back to .png format,<br>
    you can use the export function in the main window.<br> 
    First, use the search function to filter the database view to show the entries you want to export.<br>
    Then click on the "Export Button" to export the images of the displayed entries to the specified export folder.<br>

    The program will save the images in .png format in the chosen folder,<br>
    using the original file name format for easy identification.<br>  
    A message will confirm the successful export and the location of the exported images.<br>

    5. Troubleshooting <br>

    If you encounter any issues while using the Eqsl Program, here are some common troubleshooting steps:<br>
    - Ensure that you have set up the database and imported your ADIF log file correctly in the Settings window.<br>
